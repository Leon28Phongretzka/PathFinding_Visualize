## Pathfinding Algorithms
- Breadth First Search = unweighted and gives shortest path
- Depth First Search = unweighted and doesn't give shortest path
- Dijkstra's Algorithm = weighted and gives shortest path

## Maze Generation Algorithms
- Randomized DFS = http://www.migapro.com/depth-first-search/

### TODO
**Algorithms side**
- Maybe generate random grid with walls & weights?
UNINFORMED SEARCH
- Iterative Deepening Search
- Bidirectional Search
INFORMED SEARCH (heuristics)
- A* Search = Implement other heuristic functions
- Greedy best-first search
- RBFS (recursive best-first search)
- SMA* (simplified memory-bounded A*)

- Maze Division Algo = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41553775/maze-generation-recursive-division-how-it-works

**Frontend side**
- Add stop, play, pause, RESET button
- Add use same board button which when clicked displays same board used before an algorithm is visualized
- Update grid size responsively (Help Needed)
